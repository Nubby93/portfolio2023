		<p class="max-width-50">My task was to craft icons that are historically and geographically accurate for Africa and the Americas. I did research on the types of armies used during the colonial era. My goal was to document each country or tribe that was going to be featured in the game. </p>

		<article class="flex-col-gap-8"><p><strong>1-D: Define</strong></p><p>Icon categories</p></article>
		<p class="max-width-50">The icons are divided in 3 categories: units, items, and country flags, and each is divided in 3 more subcategories.</p>

		<p class="max-width-50">The unit icons for the Europen and Asian maps have a rusty, pixelated border. The source file was unavailable so I had to recreate it.</p>

		<article class="flex-col-gap-8"><p><strong>2-D: Design</strong></p><p>Progression between the tiers</p></article>
		<p class="max-width-50">I used related symbols to create a clear relationship between each tier of the same unit. In the case of Africa’s Masaai line, at tier 1, the unit is represented by a rudimentary weapon, at tier 2 the weapon is improved and a knitted shirt is added. At tier 3 an African style mask replaces the weapon. </p>

		<article class="flex-col-gap-8"><p><strong>2-D: Design</strong></p><p>Progression between the tiers</p></article>
		<p class="max-width-50">The Americas’ Native line is also a good example. At tier 1 Natives are represented by a head piece decorated with colourful featers. At tier 2 the Native Archer is represented by a bow and arrow. The Brave, its tier 3, is a combo of the previous 2 tiers: a colourful head piece and a bow.</p>

		<p class="max-width-50">I exported each icon as a 60x60 .png and 1024x1024 .svg. I sent them over to the TLK development team using WeTransfer, and made myself available for redesigns until everything was moved into production.</p>
